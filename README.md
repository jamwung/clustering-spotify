![title-header](images/title.png)

Welcome to the `clustering-spotify` project repository, where we explore the world of music data analysis. This project delves into the intriguing realm of hit songs on Spotify and their evolving audio characteristics spanning five decades.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Understanding the dynamics and trends in hit songs on Spotify, with a focus on audio features.
- **Methods:** An analysis methodology comprising exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, statistical testing, Gaussian Mixture Modeling, and trend analysis.

## Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** We embarked on an insightful journey through the Spotify dataset, employing exploratory data analysis techniques. This phase allowed us to uncover relationships between variables, address data issues, and set the stage for further analysis.

- **Data Preprocessing:** To ensure the quality and relevance of our analysis, we applied statistical testing and transformations to assess data normality and transform variables when needed. This step was crucial in preparing the data for subsequent analysis.

- **Soft Clustering:** Utilizing Gaussian Mixture Modeling, we ventured into the realm of soft clustering to identify overlapping or fuzzy clusters within the dataset. This helped uncover hidden patterns in the audio features of hit songs.

- **Trend Analysis:** The journey culminated in trend analysis, where we examined how the characteristics of hit songs have evolved over time within the identified clusters. This provided valuable insights into the dynamic nature of popular music.

## Implications

Our findings shed light on the changing landscape of hit songs, highlighting the growing preference for songs that evoke movement and energy with danceable beats and fast tempos. Artists, producers, and marketers can leverage these insights to inform their creative decisions, promotional strategies, and target audience identification. This clustering analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns and trends within Spotify hit songs, empowering stakeholders to make data-driven decisions and navigate the ever-evolving music landscape more effectively.
